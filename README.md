Auto-generated crossword puzzles using various methods of generation

From this source, I have gathered that we can generation is an NP-hard problem, therefore there will be no polynomial time algorithm to generate these crosswords, so we can expect it to take

Also, according to this stack overflow, there are multiple ways to create crossword puzzles, with some advantages over others: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/943113/algorithm-to-generate-a-crossword

Perhaps the goal should be to design 3 different algorithms for crossword generation (1 for each group member with AI inspired ideals), and then we can do a metaanalysis/demonstration of how these different algorithms performed. 

Want to try to create crossoword puzzles with intersections

Standard sizing?

Each tries a different optimization:
  num words fit in there
  average length of words in there
  best time complexity
  
  
Don't worry about clues, just try and place words


Use cornell generated words
