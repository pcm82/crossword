Things to do (updated November 29):

TODO:
-Fix TODO 11.30.49 and TODO 11.30.50 in Crossword.py(just what I named them)
-Change our code to reflect the threshold problem
-Come up with GUI or video of GUI
-Work on final report


Perhaps: 
-Verify that our problem is in fact np-complete or satisfiable
-Use a larger word database
